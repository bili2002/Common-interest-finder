# Common-interest-finder

A tool you can use with your friends to find what activity to do together. You would create a list with activities and each one of you would give a rate to each activity, after which a function to find the best one would give you the desired results.

TO DO:
- Right now the function makes sense only for two people.

To start the project:
```console
python .\runner.py start
```

To add interests:
```console
python .\runner.py add arg1 [arg2, ..., argn]
```

To add rates for people:
```console
python .\runner.py rate arg1 [arg2, ..., argn]
```

To find common interests between people:
```console
python .\runner.py find arg1 [arg2, ..., argn]
```

To do both of the above:
```console
python .\runner.py all arg1 [arg2, ..., argn]
```
